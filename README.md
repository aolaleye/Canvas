# Canvas

One of the new elements introduced in HTML5 was the "Canvas" element. This project combines the new HTML5 feature with jQuery mouse events to create a simple drawing application.

* By clicking the 'Create New Color' button, the user can use the red, green and blue controls to create a new color.
* Clicking the 'Add Color to Pallet' button will add the newly created color to the pallet.
* The user can then select any of the colors from the pallet and draw on the canvas!
